# Blog Project Instructions

## Overview
This project is a blog website built using a Bootstrap theme. The home page will feature a modern header and footer, and will be organized into two main sections for easy navigation.

## Requirements
- Use Bootstrap for styling and layout (choose a modern, responsive theme).
- The home page must include:
  - A header (site title, navigation links, etc.)
  - A footer (copyright, contact info, etc.)
  - Two main content sections:
    1. **Section 1:**
       - System Design
       - Microservices
       - Object Oriented Programming
    2. **Section 2:**
       - Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
       - Java Cards

## Suggested Structure
- `/index.html` (Home page)
- `/assets/` (CSS, JS, images)
- `/sections/` (Separate HTML files for each topic, optional)

## Steps to Get Started
1. **Set up the project folder:**
   - Create a new folder for your blog project.
   - Add Bootstrap via CDN or download.
2. **Design the home page:**
   - Add a header using Bootstrap's navbar component.
   - Create two main sections using Bootstrap's grid system:
     - Section 1: Cards or columns for System Design, Microservices, OOP.
     - Section 2: Cards or columns for DSA and Java Cards.
   - Add a footer using Bootstrap's footer utilities.
3. **Create content pages:**
   - Optionally, create separate pages for each topic and link them from the home page.
4. **Customize the theme:**
   - Choose colors, fonts, and layout options to match your style.
5. **Test responsiveness:**
   - Ensure the site looks good on mobile and desktop.

## Example Bootstrap Components to Use
- Navbar (header)
